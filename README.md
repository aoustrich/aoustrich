## About Me

I'm a Senior studying Statistics: Data Science at Brigham Young University, where GitHub is becoming an essential part of my academic life. I love tackling challenging problems and applying what I've learned in class to real-world projects.

### Why am I studying Statistics and Data Science?
> If you torture the data long enough, it will confess to anything. - Ronald Coase [](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/if_you_torture_the_data_long_enough,_it_will_confess_to_anything)

I've seen how misleading numbers can be and how easily model predictions can become inaccurate when assumptions are violated. I want to know how data is tortured so I can prevent it from happening in my analyses.
